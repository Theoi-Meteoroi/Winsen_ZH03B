# Winsen ZH03B Particle Detector 

## CircuitPython files have moved.  See: https://github.com/Theoi-Meteoroi/Carboncycle_CircuitPython_ZH03B


This project is a Python3 program and function library to obtain sample readings of particle density from a ZH03B detector attached to a Raspberry Pi USB port.  The specific port is currently hard-coded to /dev/ttyUSB1. The code has only been tested over a USB bridge interface (CP2102) on Raspian Stretch and OSx High Sierra.

### Files

Winsen_ZH03B.py - obtain exactly one single sample reading from sensor running in default 'streaming readings' mode. 
                  To make readings continuous -  modify the while-loop to always be TRUE. This program is not compatible with 
                  Python2. This program does not utilize the function library and is standalone.
                  
Library/test_ZH03B_lib.py - Exercise the function library in a loop

Library/ZH03B_lib.py  - Complete function library for the ZH03B. Enable/Disable sample fan to save power. Not compatible with Python2
       
 ### Running the program -
 <prompt> python3 Winsen_ZH03B.py

Sample reading:

###   PM1 level:  60 PM2.5 level:  121 PM10 level:  149
